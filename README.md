Or using a local Vagrant installation instead

AWS
===

This automated deployment script assumes that you have the following in your AWS console:

1. Created a [keypair called `neurostars`](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-west-1#KeyPairs:) in your Amazon account.
2. Locally defined both AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_KEY [environment variables for your AWS user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=eu-west-1#users)
3. Installed both [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) on your local machine.

Then, just running `vagrant up` should suffice! :)
